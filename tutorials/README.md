# PyGWalker Tutorials

This directory contains in-depth, step-by-step tutorials designed to complement the concise scripts in `/examples`.
While the examples demonstrate specific features quickly, the tutorials focus on **progressive learning**, **real-world workflows**, and **best practices** for using PyGWalker effectively.

### Included

* **`complete_tutorial.ipynb`**
  A comprehensive beginner-to-intermediate notebook covering:

  * environment setup and initialization
  * core chart types and interactions
  * data exploration workflows
  * real use cases (sales analytics, segmentation, experimentation)
  * performance tips and recommended patterns

This notebook is output-free to keep the repository lightweight, as interactive PyGWalker cells may generate large HTML payloads.
