## Running examples
Each example includes its own set of requirements and setup instructions within the file. Make sure you have Pygwalker installed:
```shell
pip install pygwalker
```

Additional dependencies may be required based on the specific interface you're using (e.g., streamlit, dash, gradio).
For the Reflex demo, install the optional Reflex plugin:
```shell
pip install "pygwalker[reflex]"
```
